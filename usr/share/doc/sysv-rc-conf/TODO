TODO for sysv-rc-conf:

* "less" like search so you can type in a few letters of the service and the
    cursor jumps you to that row. Curses::UI supports this, just need to 
    implement it the right way into the program
* Colors, which Curses::UI also supports. I just haven't bothered trying
    to make the program look good with colors.
* HALF DONE: Speed the program up. Initial thought it that each rl / service
    shouldn't have it's own ListBox object and should just use one for the
    whole row. I really want to do this horizontally though, so all rows for
    the current service will be bolded. Curses::UI doesn't support that at 
    the moment, I plan to write a ptach to implement this. In the meantime
    the Listbox objects should get changed to Checkboxes, since that is really
    all they are, just a single checkbox.
* DONE: A way to restore symlinks to what they were when the program started
* Change from priority mode to normal mode on the fly
* Re-order columns on the fly
* Re-order rows on the fly
* Check for unconfigured entries (no-symlink is not allowed)
* Expand service name on demand to full name (toggle by v)
* In priority mode: enable PageUp/PageDown. K and S should start overwrite.
* Enable non-control normal character as alias for each command (vi/emacs)
* DONE: --version or something to say what version of the program you're
     currently using.
* Update xinetd.d/* files
* Press F1 or something to actually view the script
